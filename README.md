# Overview
While working in domain of inventory management and data reporting for Zola, I had worked on automating reporting and inventory management systems. This was done using VBA Macros. The aim was to:
1. Increase backend operational efficiency.
2. Save time for fellow employees to focus on analysing the data.
3. Making reporting system seamless.

# Content
There are two folders. One is related to reporting and other related to inventory management. In each folder, there is a Macro enabled excel file, VBA macro code seperately provided on html file, and associated  excel files. 

# How was it Used?
The employees used the template files. They pasted file paths of assocaited excel files at the specified cell and ran the code using the button provided to give foundational sale report or perform inventory manipulation as per need.

# How to Run?
One should download all the excel files. Note that template file should be downloaded in Macro enabled excel format. Copy file paths of the associated excel files in the template files and simply run.
If one want to only view the macro code, it is provided in the html file.
